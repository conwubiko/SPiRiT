# SPiRiT
SPiRIT â€“ Adaptive Intelligence-led CyberSA, target completion date, 2023. The background to the project is about Machine Learning for Cyber Security, the case of using Machine Learning and data science concepts to analyse incomplete, conflicting and complementary intelligence in order to make informed decision. The model should be able to incorporate new intelligence and enrichments and as when new intelligence becomes available the model can adapt and hence reinforce its belief system in order to make plausible decisions in the face of new intelligence. While the model may be applied to Cyber, it should be agnostic and hence can be applied to various domains. The project sponsors do not wish for it to be made publicly available yet.
